SNAKE GAME

This is a simple implementation of the classic snake game using everything we've learned in the class so far. The goal of the game is pretty simple, control a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow larger and larger. The game will end either when the snake collides with itself due to it's size or hit the walls of the game board.


*Insert SS of final product of game here*


FEATURES

1. Classic Gameplay: The game follows the original rules, where the snake will move across the grid, and the player can control the snake's direction using arrow keys or "wasd" on the keyboard.
2. Collision Detection: The game detects if the snake collides with itself or the walls and ends the game.
3. Random Food Generation: Food is generated at random positions across the game board after the snake eats it.
4. Score: The game keeps track of palyer's score, which increases as the snake eats more food.
5. Responsive Canvas: The game board will automatically scale with the browser window size 
6. Timer: A 60 second timer will begin ticking down once the game has begun, once that timer reaches 0, game over! You can collect +'s to increase the timer by 10 seconds, but be weary of the -'s that will decrease the time by 10 seconds.
